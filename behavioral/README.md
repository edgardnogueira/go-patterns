# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.

## Patterns

- [Chain of Responsibility](chain/): A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- [Command](command/): Encapsulate a command request as an object
- [Iterator](iterator/): Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- [Mediator](mediator/): Defines simplified communication between classes
- [Memento](memento/): Capture and restore an object's internal state
- [Observer](observer/): A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- [State](state/): Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- [Strategy](strategy/): Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- [Template Method](template/): Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- [Visitor](visitor/): Defines a new operation to a class without change
