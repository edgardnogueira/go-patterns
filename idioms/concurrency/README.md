# Go Concurrency Patterns

Go's approach to concurrency is one of its most powerful features, built around goroutines and channels. This directory contains implementations of common concurrency patterns used in Go programming.

## Overview

Go concurrency is built on a few key concepts:

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime
- **Channels**: Type-safe pipes that connect goroutines
- **Select**: A control structure for working with multiple channels
- **Sync Package**: Low-level synchronization primitives like mutexes and wait groups

## Patterns Included

The following patterns are implemented in this directory:

1. **Worker Pools**: Distributing work across a fixed number of worker goroutines
2. **Fan-Out/Fan-In**: Splitting work among multiple goroutines and collecting results
3. **Pipeline**: Creating sequential processing stages connected by channels
4. **Generators**: Functions that yield values through channels
5. **Channel Signaling**: Coordinating goroutines using channel communication
6. **Context Cancellation**: Using Go's context package for graceful cancellation
7. **Rate Limiting**: Controlling throughput of operations
8. **Heartbeat Pattern**: Monitoring long-running goroutines
9. **Semaphore Pattern**: Limiting concurrent access to resources
10. **Pub/Sub Pattern**: Broadcasting events to multiple subscribers
11. **Futures/Promises**: Asynchronous result handling in Go style

## Best Practices

- Always ensure goroutines terminate properly to avoid leaks
- Use buffered channels when appropriate to reduce blocking
- Consider using context for cancellation propagation
- Prefer channel communication over shared memory and locks
- Properly handle errors in concurrent code
- Use appropriate synchronization methods for the task
- Consider performance implications of your concurrency strategy

## Usage

Each pattern directory contains:
- Implementation code
- Unit tests
- Examples demonstrating practical usage
- Documentation explaining the pattern and its applications
