# Worker Pool Pattern

The Worker Pool pattern is a concurrency pattern used to distribute work among a pool of worker goroutines, efficiently processing tasks in parallel.

## Pattern Overview

Worker Pools solve problems where many similar tasks need to be processed concurrently. Instead of creating a new goroutine for each task (which could lead to resource exhaustion), a fixed number of worker goroutines are created upfront and tasks are distributed among them.

### Key Components

1. **Worker**: A goroutine that processes tasks from a shared queue
2. **Task Queue**: A channel that distributes tasks to workers
3. **Result Queue**: A channel where workers send their results
4. **Pool Manager**: Coordinates the workers and handles task submission

### Benefits

- **Resource Control**: Limits the number of concurrent goroutines
- **Load Balancing**: Automatically distributes work across available workers
- **Throughput**: Increases processing throughput for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks
- **Backpressure Handling**: Naturally handles backpressure when tasks are added faster than they can be processed

## Implementation Details

Our implementation provides:

- A generic worker pool that can handle any type of task
- Context-aware operation for proper cancellation
- Clean shutdown mechanism
- Task result collection
- Worker identification for monitoring and debugging

## Usage Scenarios

Worker pools are particularly useful for:

- Web servers processing multiple requests
- Batch processing large datasets
- Processing work items from a queue
- Background job processing
- Parallel data transformation pipelines
- CPU or I/O bound operations that benefit from parallelism

## Example

See the [example directory](./example) for a complete working example demonstrating the Worker Pool pattern in action.

## Best Practices

- Choose an appropriate worker count based on the nature of your workload (CPU-bound vs I/O-bound)
- Consider using buffered channels for the task queue to handle burst loads
- Always implement proper error handling in workers
- Ensure proper cleanup of resources when the pool is stopped
- Monitor worker performance to optimize the pool size
