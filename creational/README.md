# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

## Patterns

- [Factory Method](factory/): Creates an instance of several derived classes
- [Abstract Factory](abstract/): Creates an instance of several families of classes
- [Builder](builder/): Separates object construction from its representation
- [Prototype](prototype/): A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- [Singleton](singleton/): A class of which only a single instance can exist
