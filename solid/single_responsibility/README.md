# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Definition

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. In other words, each class or module should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software.

## Key Concepts

- A class or module should have only one job or responsibility
- There should be only one reason for a class or module to change
- Responsibilities should be separated and assigned to different classes or modules

## Benefits

- Easier to understand and maintain code
- Reduces the impact of changes
- Improves testability
- Reduces coupling between components

## Go Implementation Example

This directory contains a real-world example of the Single Responsibility Principle implemented in Go. The example demonstrates how to properly separate responsibilities in a Go application.
