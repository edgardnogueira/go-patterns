# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

## Definition

The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

## Key Concepts

- Existing code remains unchanged when adding new functionality
- Extensions happen through abstractions (interfaces in Go)
- New behavior is added by creating new types rather than changing existing ones

## Benefits

- Reduces the risk of bugs in existing code
- Makes the system more maintainable and scalable
- Promotes loose coupling between components
- Facilitates parallel development

## Go Implementation Example

This directory contains a real-world example of the Open/Closed Principle implemented in Go. The example demonstrates how to design code that can be extended without modification.
