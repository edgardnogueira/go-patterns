# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## Definition

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.

## Key Concepts

- Subtypes must be behaviorally substitutable for their base types
- Subtypes must satisfy the contracts and invariants of base types
- Subtypes should not require more restrictive input parameters
- Subtypes should not provide weaker guarantees in their output

## Benefits

- Ensures that inheritance hierarchies are correctly designed
- Allows for polymorphic behavior that behaves predictably
- Improves code reusability
- Makes code more robust and reliable

## Go Implementation Example

This directory contains a real-world example of the Liskov Substitution Principle implemented in Go. The example demonstrates how to create proper type hierarchies that respect behavioral substitutability.
