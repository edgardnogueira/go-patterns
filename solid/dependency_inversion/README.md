# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Definition

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## Key Concepts

- High-level modules define abstractions (interfaces) that low-level modules implement
- Dependencies flow toward abstractions, not concrete implementations
- Source code dependencies point opposite to the flow of control
- Decouples components through abstractions

## Benefits

- Reduces coupling between modules
- Increases system flexibility and maintainability
- Facilitates testing through dependency injection
- Supports better parallel development

## Go Implementation Example

This directory contains a real-world example of the Dependency Inversion Principle implemented in Go. The example demonstrates how to structure code to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
