# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

## Patterns

- [Adapter](adapter/): Match interfaces of different classes
- [Bridge](bridge/): Separates an object's interface from its implementation
- [Composite](composite/): A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- [Decorator](decorator/): Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- [Facade](facade/): A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- [Flyweight](flyweight/): A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- [Proxy](proxy/): An object representing another object
