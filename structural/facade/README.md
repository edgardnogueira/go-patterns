# Facade Pattern

## Intent
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it easier to use. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by reducing complexity and hiding the communication and dependencies between subsystems.

## Problem
You need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. The classes and relationships in the subsystem may be confusing for clients, and you want to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems.

## Solution
The Facade Pattern suggests creating a facade class that provides a simple, unified interface to a set of interfaces in the subsystem. It doesn't encapsulate the subsystem classes but works with them to simplify their use. The facade delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.

## Structure
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to the subsystem, delegating client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.
- **Subsystem Classes**: Implement subsystem functionality and handle work assigned by the facade. They don't know about the facade.

## Implementation
In this implementation, we create a multimedia conversion system where various components handle different aspects of media processing. The MediaConverterFacade provides a simplified interface to these complex components, making it easier for clients to perform common media operations.

The key elements are:
- The MediaConverterFacade (Facade)
- Several subsystem components:
  - VideoProcessor: For handling video streams and formats
  - AudioProcessor: For managing audio processing
  - CodecManager: For handling different codecs
  - FileSystem: For reading/writing files
  - MetadataHandler: For extracting and modifying metadata
  - ProgressReporter: For tracking conversion progress

## When to use
- When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- When there are many dependencies between clients and implementation classes
- When you want to layer your subsystems and use the facade as an entry point

## Benefits
- Isolates clients from subsystem components, reducing coupling
- Promotes weak coupling between subsystems and clients
- Doesn't prevent applications from using subsystem classes directly
- Simplifies the use of complex subsystems for most clients while allowing advanced clients to access the underlying components

## Drawbacks
- The facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of the app
- May add a level of indirection that affects performance
- May hide useful lower-level functionality from developers who need it

## Go-Specific Implementation Notes
In Go, the Facade Pattern is implemented using structs and interfaces. The facade struct typically contains fields that are instances of subsystem components, and its methods delegate to the appropriate subsystem components. This showcases Go's composition approach to software design rather than inheritance-based approaches in some other languages.
